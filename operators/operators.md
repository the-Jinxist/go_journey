## Operators in Go
Decided to just write a markup file for this, to be doing operations is too much for me jhur. It's almost the same as most programming languages, basically the same, mostly. It's the sameðŸŒš

### Arithemetic operators
Different ways to do the most mundane of operations

\+	Addition	    x + y	Sum of x and y
\-	Subtraction	    x - y	Subtracts one value from another
\*	Multiplication	x * y	Multiplies two values
/	Division	    x / y	Quotient of x and y
%	Modulus	        x % y	Remainder of x divided by y
++	Increment	    x++	    Increases the value of a variable by 1
--	Decrement	    x--   	Decreases the value of a variable by 1

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators, weird shorthands. still nice to know.

x = y	Assign	                     x = y
x += y	Add and assign	             x = x + y
x -= y	Subtract and assign	         x = x - y
x *= y	Multiply and assign	         x = x * y
x /= y	Divide and assign quotient	 x = x / y
x %= y	Divide and assign modulus	 x = x % y


### Comparisons in GO
Comparisons aren't good o. No dey run another person race with him. Anyways..

==	Equal	                    x == y	True if x is equal to y
!=	Not equal	                x != y	True if x is not equal to y
<	Less than	                x < y	True if x is less than y
<=	Less than or equal to	    x <= y	True if x is less than or equal to y
\>	Greater than	            x > y	True if x is greater than y
\>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	True if x is greater than or equal to y

### Logical Operators
Mostly used in if statements, i guess?

&&	Logical And	Returns true if both statements are true	             x < y && x > z
||	Logical Or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	         x < y || x > z
!	Logical Not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	 !(x == y && x > z)
