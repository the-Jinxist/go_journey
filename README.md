## My Go Learning Journey

I will be documenting my jourmey through learning GO in this repository, go help me GOD! Learnt primitive go stuff using the official documentation here: https://www.golangprograms.com/go-language/variables.html. Learning rest api through a short course that probably shouldn't have paid for here: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-restful-api-with-golang-go-programming-language/learn/lecture/11760566#overview

### Day 1

Started writing Go. Was unable to import external libraries. After many tries and pulling my hair out, it finally worked.

#### Learned:
- Learnt about variable declaration, different data types and types of variable initialization
- Also learnt about go naming conventions, another thing to look out for.
- Conversion of data types
- Operators in Go
- Learnt conditional and control structures i.e if-else and switch

### Day 2
Learning about strange Go stuff. Somehow exciting

#### Learned:
- For loops.
- Learned functions, anonymous functions, higher-order functions. Also saw that functions that starts with an uppercase letter can be exported and ones with lowercase are not exported.
- Deferred function calls, worth mentioning, make sure a function is called when it's finished
- Panic! at the golang. Learnt about panic and recovery

### Day 3

#### Learned:
- Arrays: Declaring, Initializing.
- Filtering arrays and looping through them.
- Slices: Declarind and Initializing them. They seem like weird stuff to be honest.
